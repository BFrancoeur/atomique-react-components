# Atomique React CMS

This CMS is my attempt at a next-generation content management system that's based on Brad Frost's *Atomic Design* theory. The idea is to create a CMS that's built for today's API-connected world. All components will be reusable and customizable, bound together by a design system that's based on current web design best practices. 

## Approach
Create components and iron out the design system end of this project so that a consistent, coherent, and easy-to-use design system is in place. 

## Process
    1. Create the design system architecture
        1.1. Color Scheme 
        1.2. Typography
        1.3  Component Architecture, based on Atomic Design Theory
        
    2. Build React Components
        2.1 Atoms -- The fundamental building blocks of all websites. This includes buttons, input fields, HTML tags (h1, h2 ... p, etc) 
        2.2 Molecules -- Components created from Atom components. A submit button is a molecule. 
        2.3 Organisms -- Components built with both Atoms and Molecules. Basic forms are an example of an Organism
        2.4 Templates -- Components that are created with combinations of Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms. Used to determine the layout and display of specific types               of content.
        2.5 Pages -- The web page that is generated from the Template. 
        
    3. Evaluate Consistency in the Application of the Atomic Design Theory
        3.1 Are all components truly reusable? 
        3.2 Is the design system consistent? 
        3.3 Is the library of components easy to use and integrate into a project? 
        3.4 Is the architecture of the design system scalable>?
        3.5 Is the architecture of the components scalable? 
        
    4. Refactor Architecture and Component Code
        4.1 Document and fix all discovered inconsistencies 
        4.2 Document and resolve user issues
        4.3 Document and resolve any bugs that may be discovered
        
    5. Launch Atomique Component Library
    
    6. Continue development of library and features
